Welcome to Vumi Go's documentation!
===================================

Vumi Go is a hosted version of Vumi. Where Vumi gives you the tools to build
large scale messaging applications, Vumi Go provides you with a working
environment that is already integrated into numerous countries.

Vumi Go offers the following on top of Vumi:

* Managing contact information and groups of contacts.
* The ability to store all messages sent and received.
* A set of applications ready for you to use.
* A sandboxed Javascript environment for you to use to develop (and host)
  your own applications that will run on our scalable infrastructure.

This documentation is mostly geared towards beginning developers interested
in building Javascript based applications that can be hosted on Vumi Go
and which can interact with a user base via SMS, USSD and other messaging
channels.
